// ...........................................................................
// This is the version of the SOFTWARE.  This shows up in 3 places:
//
// (1) config-file parsing.  In this case the config-file will have a
//     version, and the parser compares it with the defines here, to
//     assure that it is competent to perform the parse.
//
// (2) xattr parsing.  Metadata files written by this software will have
//     xattrs identifying their config SW version.  When parsing xattrs
//     (e.g. in str_2_pre()), we can thus be sure we know which version of
//     the software wrote those xattrs.  This also identifies potential
//     changes in chunk-info written into MD files for Multis, or in the
//     recovery-info written into the tail of objects.
//
// (3) object-IDs.  The version number is also stored in obj-IDs, which
//     also include strings from xattrs.  As with (2), this potentially
//     allows future parsers to select the right parser for a given
//     version.  This also allows major changes in the code to be reflected
//     in a new "series" of object-IDs.  Thus, supposing there were some
//     problem, we could determine which objects were written with which
//     code version.
//     
// These are all somewhat independent.  config-version identifies
// config-reader parser that's needed.  This may relate to what information
// is kept in xattrs, but might not affect xattrs.  Meanwhile,
// recovery-info formats could change without any changes to the config
// reader.
//
// For now, we are just glossing the problem.  What goes into object-IDs is
// what is found in MARFS_CONFIG_MAJOR/MINOR, so changes to either (1) or
// (2) above, should be reflected in changes these #defines.  No reason you
// can't increment the version number whenever you want, as well, e.g. to
// associate objects with versions of code that were in use.  (See 1.9)
//
// HISTORY
//
// -- 0.1  First cut.
//
// -- 0.2 Added Repo.max_request_size.  Will be defaulted (to 0) by reader,
//        for older config-files.  No changes to xattrs, MD, or objects.
//
// -- 0.3 Added HTTP_DIGEST as an option for Repo.security_method
//
//        Changed Repo.max_request_size to Repo.max_get_size, because I
//        couldn't stand how ambiguous it was.
//
// -- 0.4 Now generating real recovery-info into the tails of objects
//
// -- 0.5 moved version-string as first thing after "HEAD:/", in rec-info
//
// -- 1.0 new objids, with http://host:port/ns_alias/repo/vers/ns/...
//        Makes adding new namespaces simpler for admins.
//        Allows repos to select sproxyd driver-alias.
//
// -- 1.1 recovery-info tail has *length* of recovery-info, rather than
//        offset.  This allows recovery in the more-efficient case where
//        the packer combines small objects without segregating the
//        recovery-info at the end of the packed object.  Format of the
//        object tail also uses "reclen" instead of "recoff".
//
// -- 1.2 config parsing changes. removed repo.pack_size.  Added
//        repo.min/max_pack_file_size, and repo.min/max_pack_file_count.
//
// -- 1.3 restart xattrs include an optional mode, which will be installed
//        at close-time.  This allows read-only files to be opened RW, so
//        that we can install xattrs.
//
// -- 1.4 Added mdfs_top to config, with checking in open() and opendir()
//        to forbid access, in case something gets past unshare.
//
// -- 1.5 Not strictly a change in config.  Moved parsing to libmarfs,
//        leaving libconfig with only the PA2X interface.
//
// -- 1.6 MarFS now includes the multi-component DAL
//
// -- 1.7 Added timing_flags spec to NS/Repo config, added parsing, and
//        abstracted out parsing of iperms/bperms to be similar.
//
// -- 1.8 fixed rename/unlink bug (issue 200) by having stat_xattrs()
//        ignore the md_path in the POST xattr, unless its new extra
//        argument is non-zero.
//
// -- 1.9 No changes to xattr or obj-ID format, but we're introducing RDMA
//        (DAL) to production, which will also co-exist with NFS (DAL).
//        Changing the object-version number in case we ever might wish we
//        had done so, in order to hunt for issues.)
//
// -- 1.10  Same as 1.9, but after merging rdma to master.  This allows us
//          to refer to "1.10" and clearly mean after that merge.
//
// -- 1.11  Merged in new multi-threaded reads, in libne.  Again, just
//          incrementing version to make a distinction in object-IDs.
//
// -- 1.12  Version bump to match the current tag.
//
